        I need help with an automated email response workflow. Here's what I need you to do:

        1. **Email Analysis**: Scan my recent Gmail messages (last 7 days) to find emails where people (they have gmail.com in their emails) are requesting documents, reports, work updates, or asking for completed tasks.

        2. **Document Discovery**: Check my Google Docs for documents that have "Done" in their title - these represent work I've completed.

        3. **Intelligent Matching**: For each "Done" document, use your AI capabilities to determine if it corresponds to any of the recent email requests. Consider:
           - Subject line keywords
           - Sender information  
           - Content context
           - Timeline alignment

        4. **Professional Response Generation**: For each matched pair:
           - Read the Google Doc content and generate a concise, professional summary
           - Convert the Google Doc to PDF format
           - Compose a professional REPLY email that:
             * REPLIES DIRECTLY to the original email (not a new email)
             * Uses proper email threading with "Re:" prefix in subject
             * Includes the In-Reply-To and References headers for proper conversation threading
             * References the original request appropriately in the email body
             * Includes the document summary in the email body
             * Attaches the PDF version of the document
             * CC's me at {user_email} so I can see what was sent
             * Appears in the same conversation thread as the original request
           - Send the REPLY email (not a new standalone email)

        5. **Email Threading Requirements**: 
           - CRITICAL: Each response must be sent as a REPLY to the original email
           - The reply must appear in the same conversation thread in Gmail
           - Use proper email headers to maintain conversation threading
           - Subject should be "Re: [original subject]"

        6. **Reporting**: Provide me with a summary of all actions taken, including which documents were matched to which emails and what responses were sent.

        Please be intelligent and contextual in your matching - don't just rely on exact keyword matches. Use natural language understanding to make appropriate connections between requests and completed work.

        IMPORTANT: Every email you send MUST be a reply to an existing email, not a new standalone email.
