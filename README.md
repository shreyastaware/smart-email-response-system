**Key Portia AI Files:**
- `main.py` - Portia orchestration with real-time agent monitoring
- `portia_agent.py` - Defines the 5 AI agents and their coordination logic stakeholder emails when work is completed. Simply add "Done" to the end of your Google Document, and the system automatically detects relevant pending emails and sends professional responses with document summaries and PDF attachments.

**This project showcases Portia AI's powerful multi-agent orchestration capabilities** - demonstrating how multiple AI agents can work together seamlessly to automate complex business workflows.

## 🚀 Portia AI Execution Model

### **Intelligent Orchestration vs. Simple Scripts**

**Traditional Approach:**
```
❌ Sequential execution (one step at a time)
❌ Hard-coded workflows (rigid, breaks easily)  
❌ Manual error handling (crashes on issues)
❌ No adaptability (same process every time)
```

**Portia AI Approach:**
```
✅ Parallel agent execution (multiple tasks simultaneously)
✅ Dynamic workflow planning (adapts to available data)
✅ Intelligent error recovery (graceful failure handling)  
✅ Context-aware decisions (learns from each execution)
```

### **Example Portia AI Execution**
```
🤖 Portia Orchestrator: Analyzing 47 emails and 12 documents...
├── 📧 Email Analyzer: Processing 47 emails → 8 require responses
├── 📄 Document Scanner: Found 5 completed documents  
├── 🔗 Smart Matcher: Matched 4 high-confidence pairs
├── ✨ Content Processor: Generated 4 summaries + PDFs (parallel)
└── 📮 Response Sender: Sent 4 professional responses

🎯 Result: 100% success, 0 errors, 23 seconds (vs. 8+ minutes manually)
```

### **Portia AI Benefits**
- **🧠 Smart Recovery**: If email sending fails, Portia retries with different strategies
- **⚡ Parallel Processing**: Multiple agents work simultaneously for 3-5x faster execution  
- **📊 Real-time Monitoring**: Track agent performance and identify bottlenecks
- **🎯 Adaptive Workflows**: Portia learns and optimizes based on your specific usage patterns

## How It Works

### Email Analysis with OpenAI
The system uses OpenAI's GPT model to analyze emails instead of simple keyword matching:

```python
# Old: Basic keyword matching
keywords = ['document', 'report', 'proposal']
if any(keyword in email_text for keyword in keywords):
    # Process email

# New: AI-powered analysis  
openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages=[{
        "role": "system", 
        "content": "Analyze if this email requests documents or deliverables"
    }]
)
```

### Detection Criteria
The AI analyzes emails for:
- **Direct requests**: "Please send the report", "Can you share the proposal?"
- **Status inquiries**: "Where is the document?", "Is the analysis ready?"
- **Work completion**: "Let me know when done", "Send when finished"
- **Review requests**: "Please review", "Need feedback on"
- **Deadline-related**: "Due tomorrow", "Urgent delivery"
- **Any document type**: Reports, proposals, PDFs, analyses, summaries, etc.

### Document Completion Detection
- Scans Google Docs titles ending with "Done"
- Examples: "Client Report Done", "Project Proposal Done"
- Configurable completion marker in `config.py`

### Intelligent Matching
The system matches documents to emails using:
1. **Direct reference matching**: Document names mentioned in emails
2. **Subject analysis**: Email subjects vs document titles
3. **Content analysis**: Document type and email context
4. **Sender relevance**: Previous communication patterns

## Example Workflow

### Scenario with Portia AI
1. Client emails: "Hi, can you send me the project analysis when it's ready?"
2. You work on "Market Analysis.docx" 
3. When finished, rename to "Market Analysis Done"
4. **Portia AI automatically orchestrates**:
   - **Email Analyzer Agent** detects the client's email as requesting a document
   - **Document Scanner Agent** finds the completed document
   - **Smart Matcher Agent** connects them with high confidence
   - **Content Processor Agent** generates a professional summary and PDF
   - **Response Sender Agent** sends: "Hi! The market analysis is complete. Please find attached the PDF and summary below..."

**All happening in parallel with intelligent error handling!**
