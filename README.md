# Smart Email Response System for Freelancers & Employees

## Overview

An intelligent email automation system that helps freelancers and employees automatically respond to stakeholder emails when work is completed. Simply add "Done" to the end of your Google Document, and the system automatically detects relevant pending emails and sends professional responses with document summaries and PDF attachments.

## Use Case

**Problem**: Freelancers and employees often forget to circle back with stakeholders after completing work, leading to delayed communication and frustrated clients.

**Solution**: This system monitors your Gmail and Google Docs, automatically identifying when work is complete and sending professional follow-up emails to the right stakeholders.

## Key Features

ü§ñ **AI-Powered Email Analysis**: Uses OpenAI to intelligently identify emails requesting documents, reports, or deliverables<br>
ÔøΩ **Smart Gmail Integration**: Automatically scans recent emails for document requests<br>
üìÑ **Google Docs Monitoring**: Detects completed documents marked with "Done" suffix<br>
üîç **Intelligent Matching**: Matches completed documents to relevant email requests<br>
üìù **Auto-Generated Summaries**: Creates professional document summaries using AI<br>
üìé **PDF Generation**: Automatically creates PDF attachments from Google Docs<br>
‚úâÔ∏è **Professional Responses**: Sends polished follow-up emails with summaries and attachments<br>

## Workflow

### 1. Work on Your Document
- Create or edit your Google Doc as usual
- When finished, add "Done" to the end of the document title
- Example: "Project Proposal Done" or "Meeting Report Done"

### 2. Automatic Detection
- The system scans your recent Gmail (last 7 days by default)
- Uses OpenAI to analyze email content for document requests
- Identifies emails asking for reports, proposals, updates, or any deliverables

### 3. Smart Matching
- Matches completed documents to relevant email requests
- Uses document title, email content, and sender information
- Calculates relevance scores for accurate matching

### 4. Professional Response
- Generates professional email summaries using AI
- Creates PDF versions of completed documents
- Sends response emails with summaries and PDF attachments
- Automatically replies to the original sender

## Quick Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Gmail account
- Google Drive with Google Docs
- OpenAI API access

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure API Keys
Create a `.env` file:
```env
# OpenAI Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Google API Configuration  
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id_here
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret_here

# Your Email
USER_EMAIL=your_email@gmail.com
```

### 3. Setup Google OAuth
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a project and enable Gmail API + Google Docs API
3. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials (Desktop Application)
4. Add `http://localhost:8080` to authorized redirect URIs
5. Download credentials and add Client ID/Secret to `.env`

### 4. Run the System
```bash
python run_agent.py
```

## How It Works

### Email Analysis with OpenAI
The system uses OpenAI's GPT model to analyze emails instead of simple keyword matching:

```python
# Old: Basic keyword matching
keywords = ['document', 'report', 'proposal']
if any(keyword in email_text for keyword in keywords):
    # Process email

# New: AI-powered analysis  
openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages=[{
        "role": "system", 
        "content": "Analyze if this email requests documents or deliverables"
    }]
)
```

### Detection Criteria
The AI analyzes emails for:
- **Direct requests**: "Please send the report", "Can you share the proposal?"
- **Status inquiries**: "Where is the document?", "Is the analysis ready?"
- **Work completion**: "Let me know when done", "Send when finished"
- **Review requests**: "Please review", "Need feedback on"
- **Deadline-related**: "Due tomorrow", "Urgent delivery"
- **Any document type**: Reports, proposals, PDFs, analyses, summaries, etc.

### Document Completion Detection
- Scans Google Docs titles ending with "Done"
- Examples: "Client Report Done", "Project Proposal Done"
- Configurable completion marker in `config.py`

### Intelligent Matching
The system matches documents to emails using:
1. **Direct reference matching**: Document names mentioned in emails
2. **Subject analysis**: Email subjects vs document titles
3. **Content analysis**: Document type and email context
4. **Sender relevance**: Previous communication patterns

## Example Workflow

### Scenario
1. Client emails: "Hi, can you send me the project analysis when it's ready?"
2. You work on "Market Analysis.docx" 
3. When finished, rename to "Market Analysis Done"
4. System automatically:
   - Detects the completed document
   - Identifies the client's email as requesting a document
   - Matches them together
   - Generates a professional summary
   - Creates a PDF
   - Sends: "Hi! The market analysis is complete. Please find attached the PDF and summary below..."

## Customization

### Change Completion Marker
```python
# In config.py
COMPLETION_MARKER = 'Finished'  # Instead of 'Done'
```

### Adjust Email Scan Period
```python
# In email_document_processor.py
emails = self.gmail_processor.get_recent_emails(days_back=14)  # 14 days instead of 7
```

### Modify AI Analysis
Edit the OpenAI prompt in `gmail_processor.py` to customize email analysis behavior.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **No emails detected**: Check OpenAI API key and email scan period
- **No documents found**: Ensure Google Docs titles end with "Done"  
- **Authentication errors**: Verify Google OAuth setup and redirect URIs
- **PDF generation fails**: Check file permissions and reportlab installation

### Debug Mode
Add logging to track execution:
```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

## Security & Privacy
